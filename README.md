# Biostatistics-Notebooks
> Jupyter Notebooks for Biostatistics Students to carry out statistical tests such as ANOVA, Chi Square, and T-Test using Python.

Welcome to the Biostatistics-Notebooks repository for conducting statistical tests using Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. This resource is designed for Biostatistics students at [University of Bridgeport] to analyze and interpret data for your course using statistical tests such as T-Test, ANOVA, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, you need:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): For running Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud.

### Installation

No installation is required. Simply open the notebook files in Google Colab.

## Usage

1. **Download the Desired Notebook:**
   - For example, if you would like to conduct a T-Test, please download the `TTest.ipynb` file.
3. **Upload to Google Drive:**
   - Upload the file to your Google Drive (make sure you are using the correct account, most likely the UB account).
4. **Upload the Data:**
   - Upload the data you wish to analyze to Google Drive.
   - Make sure it is in the **root** of your Google Drive (do **not** place it inside of any folders).
   - Make sure the data is in the `.csv` or `.xlsx` file formats.
5. **Run All Cells:**
   - Make sure you run each cell in the order they appear to receive all outputs and graphs.
6. **(Optional) Inspect Code to Understand the Calculations:**
   - One advantage of using Google Colab is the ability to inspect and run code alongside markup text. For those who are interested, you may inspect the code in Google Colab to learn more about how the values are calculated.
   - Depending on your programming experience, you can experiment with different values or methods to change the outputs.
